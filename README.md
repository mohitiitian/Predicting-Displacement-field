# Predicting-Displacement-field
Considering a single point load of known magnitude at the top right end of the beam I have generated the random topologies of the beam by altering the positions, sizes, and quantities of the holes in a random manner and than I have used DeepOnet to predict the displacement field and compared its performance with ANN.
